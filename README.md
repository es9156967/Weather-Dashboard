# Weather-Dashboard
Weather Dashboard for any city that you search


The seventh homework project in the UCLA coding bootcamp

HOW IT WORKS: 

This page uses Open Weather Map APIs to collect information to display on the page. Once the user arrives, they can enter a valid city name (invalid inputs will not respond) which will then show the current day's weather stats (temperature, humidity, wind speed, and the UV index) as well as the forecast for the next five days. The resulting city will then be added to a previous search tab on the page. This previous search tab will display the names of every city searched but can be cleared as well. The previously searched cities will also be saved to local storage and be displayed if the user comes back to the page later. Clearing deletes the local storage items as well.
